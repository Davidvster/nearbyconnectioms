About
----
<p>
The Quiz and Chat room is an Android app written in Kotlin that uses <a href="https://developers.google.com/nearby/connections/overview">Google's Nearby Connections API</a> and enables you to either host a chat and a quiz room or join an already available room. The room is available only locally within the range of Bluetooh/Wifi.
